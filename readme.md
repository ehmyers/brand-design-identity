Brand Identity Package
=============================================
_Cloudfuse Creations_

_Objectives_<br />
To design a fully operational identity package based off your logo. The identity package will include a letterhead, envelope and a business card. Be sure to use consistent design elements throughout the identity package and pay close attention to detail.

_Research_<br />
Start by researching successful examples of existing identity packages in books like Print’s Best Letterheads and Business Cards or on the web at www.commarts. Pay close attention to linking design elements throughout the identity and how they work together as a group. Did the package use a second font? What kind/size of paper was used? What point size were the fonts? How is the negative space activated?

_Process_<br />
• Begin by creating eight thumbnails<br />
• Concentrate on branding your system through repetition<br />
• Scale contrast will help add visual interest<br />
• Write out all information before starting<br />
• Letterhead, card and envelope equals one thumb<br />
• Supporting elements must work off your logo<br />
• Don’t forget about paper and folds as elements<br />
• Negative space activation is very important<br />
• Digitize your concepts using InDesign<br />
• Use tabs and as few text boxes as possible<br />
• Package your project to include fonts and imagery
